# Info
So, the only reason this is public is so Poggit can make builds from it. I have no clue why y'all are starring this, but whatever.

# IMPORTANT
### This is NOT intended to be a one-core-fits-all plugin, please do not use it that way. Modification for personal use is ok, but please give credit, keep original credit, and do not sell this plugin.


# Credit
So I admit I used a bit of ideas and code from other plugins. Most of this Core I did myself, but the following parts were originally made by the credited people:

- ChangeSign (Lines 116-127, and 305-343 of Core.php) were originally created by iiFlamiinBlaze.
- Day and Night Commands (214-239 of Core.php) were originally in Wertzui123s plugin (I don't know which one).
- Lightning (138-159, and 294-304 of Core.php) was originally from provsalts "LightningDeath" plugin.
- TpWorld (261-284 of Core.php) was cobbled together from multiple sources, primarily MultiWorld, and Worlds.
- NightVision was originally made by someone on Discord (Xenophilicy I believe) and further edited by someone on the PMMP Forums (If you are that person, please open an issue.)
- Broadcasts (69-83 of Core.php, 1-32 of BroadcastTask.php) was originally created by iiFlamiinBlaze in their BlazinBroadcasts plugin. I pretty much modeled the Cores broadcasts off of it.
